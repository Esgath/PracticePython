Take the code from the How To Decode A Website exercise (if you didnâ€™t do it or
just want to play with some different code, use the code from the solution),
and instead of printing the results to a screen, write the results to a txt
file. In your code, just make up a name for the file you are saving to.
Extras:
    Ask the user to specify the name of the output file that will be saved.
