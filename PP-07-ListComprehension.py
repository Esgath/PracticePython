"""
Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable:
a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100].
Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list
that has only the even elements of this list in it.
"""
# My solution:
def even(a):
    result = [num for num in a if num % 2 == 0]
    print(result)

even([1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100])
